// Running under a few assumptions:
// If CA becomes attacked, it can be reclaimed. 
// If CA is attacked, it is known and rollback can be implemented. 

// Account Creation
David: { email@email.com, password, SSN } -> Central Authority -> OK, send me your public key -> User creates public private key pair -> CA, Creates a wallet -> Wallet Database kept by CA

// Has ability to make transaction without password on any account. 
Central Authority: 
David:0, Alex: 5

// Required mechanism for rollback. 

Public Blockchain:
